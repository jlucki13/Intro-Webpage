# Intro-Webpage
This is my introductory webpage to showcase some of my new web development skills I have gained during the MIT Fullstack Certification Course. 

How to use: The "About" tab is the home page that introduces me, and the "Projects" tab can be navigated to by clicking which leads you to the second page highlighting some of my major projects. You can see my major project repos by clicking on the view button underneath each description.

Future Enhancements: Will update styling and spacing, and add more ways to connect and more projets as I build more.
